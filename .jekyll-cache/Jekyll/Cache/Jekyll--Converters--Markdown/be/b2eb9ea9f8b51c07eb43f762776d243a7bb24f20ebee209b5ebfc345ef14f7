I"’<p>Duke Royalty (AIM:DUKE) is a listed royalty investment business focussed on the European Market. Founded in 2015 by an experienced management team, Duke now manages a portfolio of Â£90m.</p>

<p>Royalty financing is a really interesting business model and has found great success in mining industries - where traditional debt or equity financing is cost restrictive or not available and a more flexible solution is required. Royalties issued by Duke are usually long-term or even perpetual (but with buy-out clauses.)</p>

<p>~~
Royalty financing involves an upfront, one-off payment in exchange for a revenue stream for a long-term or sometimes perpetual period. Duke typically receives an initial 13.5% pa (which includes principal repayment and interest) over a 30-year period. Payments are paid monthly, but reset annually linked to the change in sales revenue of the invested company or partner. Annual resets on a cash basis have a Â±6% cap and floor, which limits the movement in payment from one year to another. The royalty partners can prepay the investment, but there is a prepayment penalty designed to protect Duke from the time lag in reinvesting the money, as well the internal rate of return (IRR) of the project.</p>

<p>However most interestingly the stock price has continued a decline post Coronavirus. This is interesting on face value for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Royalties are long term cashflows, where the terminal value drive the majority of value.</li>
  <li>The business is diversified.</li>
  <li>Security over assets exist for key investments.</li>
  <li>Minimal leverage (~5x interest coverage in FY19)</li>
</ul>

<p>We note that the largest, and perhaps most risky, is the Temarca B.V business which operates leisure cruises in Europe. However from a previous RNS, Duke have first mortgage over all of these vessels, therefore one would expect Duke to be in a strong position if the business fails to recover and reopen.</p>

<h3 id="worst-case-scenarios">Worst case scenarios</h3>

<p>Debt and liquidity does not appear to be a significant risk for Duke. They managed to raise ~Â£14m in late 2019 at Â£0.44 per share. They paid a scrip dividend instead of the instead of cash in the last dividend as a precautionary measure.</p>

<p>A risk however does exist if the valuation of the underlying royalty streams significantly worsens.</p>

<p>If you assign a type of risk weighting to each of the investments (based on original investment value) of say: High risk (-40% impact), Medium (-20%), Low (-5%), Upside (0%) you would get a discounted portfolio value of ~Â£67m. After adjusting for net debt of (Â£13m), indicates a worst case scenario of valuation of Â£0.28/share.</p>
