I"‘<p>Iâ€™ve converted the previous site from <a href="https://anchorcms.com/">Anchor CMS</a> to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> to allow more flexibility (and hopefully in turn will mean more content).</p>

<p>Theme is based on <a href="https://github.com/KrisYu/Xian">Xian</a> with a few tweaks and customisations. If anyone wants a copy, please let me know and I will release to Github.</p>
