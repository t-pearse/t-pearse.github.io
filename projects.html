                <p><i>This project was the result of experimentation in a different eCommerce formats and new technologies</i>.<br /><br />
                Instead of offering deep discounts on products, prices would decrease by one cent per second until a customers has clicked 'buy' and then the price is reset and starts decreasing again etc.<br /><br />
                Actioncable (Rails' websocket implementation) was used to broadcast updates to open connections to reset the price when another customer has snapped up the deal.<br /><br />
                Apple Pay was implemented to enable one click checkout; which made for a seamless customer experience. <br /><br />

        <h2>Fixxed App</h2>

                <p>
                    This application powered the back-office of an iPhone/iPad repair business and was built and maintained using Ruby on Rails. 
                    By the time this application (and business was acquired) it had tracked thousands of repairs across multiple service centers in Australia and New Zealand.<br /><br />
                    Key features included:<br />
                    - Customer/business secure login to view repair status and accept/decline quotes.<br />
                    - Device and service tracking for reporting purposes.<br />
                    - Full audit trail of location/status of every device.<br />
                    - Email and SMS notifications.<br />
                    - Service dashboard for management to monitor KPIs.<br />
                    <br /><br />
                    This application was a key part of the competitive advantage for the business and key deal point upon acquisition.
