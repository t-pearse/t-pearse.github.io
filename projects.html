                    Debtor Insight is used by leading liquidation practices, credit managers and financiers in New Zealand to identify credit risk and business oppportunities.
                    <br /><br />
                    The platform uses natural language processing (NLP) and AI to analyse plaintext court notices relating to liquidations and receiverships in New Zealand. The platform includes custom dashboards and charting (implemented using Chart.js) and integration with the government NZBN register (using my open sourced <a href="https://github.com/t-pearse/nzbn">NZBN gem</a>).
                    <br /><br />
                    Customer subscriptions were launched in 2019 and I led business development to continued customer growth.

        <h2>Automated Audit with Xero</h2>

        <div class="row">
                <p>
                    <i>With the growing adoption of cloud accounting packages and 'open APIs', I hypothesised that it would be possible to automate a large number of audit and compliance procedures using cloud technology.</i>
                    <br /><br />
                    I built a prototype tool using Rails and the Xero API to assist in verifying and testing various account balances. I prototyped the use of OCR (through Google Vision) to verify integrity of supporting documents (invoices, receipts) against underlying ledger transactions.
                    <br /><br />
                    There are some API restrictions which make testing of various balances difficult however this project was a great introduction into building a robust finance product.

        <h2>Automated Related Party Checks - NZ</h2>

                <p><i>This was built to automate and improve the accuracy of related party checks for client engagements</i>.<br /><br />
                I developed and open soruced a Ruby wrapper for the <a href='{% post_url 2017-09-01-Updated-NZBN-api-ruby-gem %}'>NZ Companies Office</a> API </a> and built a self service web application to identify potential related party transactions.<br />
                <br />This tool uses an algorithm to identify secondary and tertiary directorships and shareholdings for current directors (and recently resigned directors) to assist an engagement team to identify potential related party conflicts.</p>
                
                <br />The application has been used to completed thousands of checks since launch in 2015.

                <p><i>This project was the result of experimentation in a different eCommerce formats and new technologies</i>.<br /><br />
                Instead of offering deep discounts on products, prices would decrease by one cent per second until a customer has clicked 'buy' and then the price is reset and starts decreasing again etc.<br /><br />
                Actioncable (Rails' websocket implementation) was used to broadcast updates to open connections to reset the price when another customer has snapped up the deal.<br /><br />
                Apple Pay was implemented to enable one click checkout; which made for a seamless customer experience. <br /><br />

                <p><i>Identified an opportunity to brand and resell iPhone 'backs' (iPhone 4/4S had rear panels which could be removed via two screws). 
                    I designed a brand, packaging and installation manuals. In addition I visited and worked with a Chinese manufacturer to develop various versions including a transparent-glass panel.
                    <br /><br />
                    Sales reached hundreds of orders per day, all being fulfilled (with help from friends) from New Zealand.

                    The business and website was acquired after an attractive offer.<br /><br />

        <h2>Fixxed App</h2>

        <div class="row">
                <p>
                    This application powered the back-office of an iPhone/iPad repair business and was built and maintained using Ruby on Rails. 
                    By the time this application (and business was acquired) it had tracked thousands of repairs across multiple service centers in Australia and New Zealand.<br /><br />
                    Key features included:<br />
                    - Customer/business secure login to view repair status and accept/decline quotes.<br />
                    - Device and service tracking for reporting purposes.<br />
                    - Full audit trail of location/status of every device.<br />
                    - Email and SMS notifications.<br />
                    - Service dashboard for management to monitor KPIs.<br />
                    <br /><br />
                    This application was a key part of the competitive advantage for the business and key deal point upon acquisition.
