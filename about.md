This website is a collection of thoughts and musings.

I have a particular interest in finance, technology and data analytics.

I am currently a Manager in the Deals team at [PwC](http://www.pwc.co.nz) in Auckland, New Zealand. 
Prior to this I founded and sold a multinational technology startup. All views are my own and not the views of my employer.
