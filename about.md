This website is personal blog mainly revolving around the topics of finance and technology.

I have a particular professional interest in finance, data analytics and technology.

I am currently a Manager in the Deals team at [PwC](http://www.pwc.co.nz) in Auckland, New Zealand. 
Prior to this I founded and sold a multinational electronic service company. All views are my own and not the views of my employer.

I occasionally write some code and try to release this publicly where possible.
