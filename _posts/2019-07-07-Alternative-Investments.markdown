The top-perfoming asset classes over the last decade have been alternative investments. These are assets such as wine and spirits, art and even classic cars. These investments [outperformed](https://thehedgefundjournal.com/recent-hedge-fund-performance/) the average hedge fund.

These markets have typically only been accessible by high net wealth individuals due to the large minimum investments (due to administration costs)and regulatory requirements (investor protection).

Over the last few years there has been an emergence of online platforms which allow the average public individual to invest in these alternative asset classes. The typical PR-pitch is typically aimed at closing the gap between these great investment opportunities only available to high net wealth individuals and making the investing process 'fun and easy' often via mobile app or slick online interface.

#### Opportunity for administration efficiency

These assets essentially operate as microfunds with administration costs attached. Administration costs are surprisingly large for fund management which is why there is often a minimum size required ($millions) in order for the average fund manager to be bothered.

Administration costs are incurred in:
- Acquiring investors through marketing (more on this below)
- Onboarding customers (completing any KYC checks)
- Payment fees (converting fiat money into 'shares')
- Operating a market to buy/sell shares.
- Maintenance (operating expenses to maintain the asset in current state - i.e. storage, security, insurance)

#### Marketing is largest cost

Most people would be surprised that marketing is likely one of the largest costs of these platforms. Particularly as most of these investments are pitching with low minimum investment amounts ([Invest in classic cars for as little as $50.](https://www.rallyrd.com/)). I suspect most of the VC money is going to large online ad spend to prove out customer acquisition strategies.

#### Liquidity

Liquidity, the ease of which someone can buy or sell a 'share' in an asset without price slippage is a key risk and concern for investors.

Platforms have typically approached this in a number of ways:
- Operate a platform allowing trading throughout the year.
- Operate a 'trading window' for 'share' sales several times a year.
- Remain null on the issue or say 'coming soon'.

#### Structure, integrity and valuation

Who owns the underlying asset from a legal perspective? Does the asset have any obligations attached to it (security agreements etc)?

Platforms appear to generally operate a seperate holding company for these assets and shares are acquired xxxxxxx

The legacy approach would be to utilise an auditor to report independently on the existence of an asset and rely on a specialist valuer to support the valuation of an asset. There is an opportunity to use other tools to prove existence and valuation of an asset. For instance existence of an asset could be provided through a third party (not necessarily an auditor) or through more alternative means (timestamped photos/videos) and valuation proved through historical data.

#### Fun vs Performance

The majority of these platforms are pitching investments as fun rather than outperformance. The reason is likely clear, these assets may not perform well in a financial sense. The best assets are likely still being acquired directly by high net wealth individuals.

Opportunity to simplify and save costs.
